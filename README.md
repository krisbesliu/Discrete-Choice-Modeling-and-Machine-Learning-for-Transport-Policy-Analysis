# Discrete-Choice-Modeling-and-Machine-Learning-for-Transport-Policy-Analysis
An empirical comparison of classical discrete choice models and machine learning methods applied to urban transport mode choice. The project focuses on predictive accuracy, substitution patterns, elasticity estimation, and counterfactual policy simulations using real-world travel data.
